ldapdisplay Plugin for DokuWiki

This plugin uses a service user to log into any LDAP system. It then displays a given LDAP request as a table inside any Page.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/3Fish/ldapdisplay

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/ldapdisplay/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
